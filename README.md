# 🌟 Introduction 🌟
Hey there! I'm João Cardoso, a 32-year-old professional transitioning from the world of hospitality into the exciting realm of web development. Having excelled as a Senior Hotel Receptionist, my journey is now taking a tech turn.

With a strong foundation in communication, teamwork, and problem-solving cultivated in the luxury hotel industry, I'm currently in the final stages of my Web Development program at ETIC_Algarve and beginning an internship at Dengun, a prestigious company in the Algarve. Here, I'm immersing myself in technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Git, Docker, React, Next.js, Django, and more, unlocking the doors to a whole new skill set.

Join me on this adventure where I blend my hospitality finesse and creative background in photography/videography with cutting-edge tech skills, crafting a story of adaptability, growth, and innovation. 🚀✨
